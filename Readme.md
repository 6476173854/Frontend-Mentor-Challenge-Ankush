What I Learned
This project helped me enhance my understanding of responsive design and dropdown navigation implementation. Below is a snippet of my HTML structure for handling responsive layout:

<div class="hero-image col-md-5 text-center order-0 order-md-1">
  <img src="./images/image-hero-desktop.png" alt="Team collaboration illustration" class="img-fluid hero-image-size">
</div>
<div class="hero-text col-md-7 text-center text-md-start order-1 order-md-0">
  <h1 class="display-4"><b>Make remote work</b></h1>
</div>
The use of order-0 and order-md-1 allows me to swap the content order based on screen size.

Continued Development
I plan to continue refining my responsive design skills and improve the use of custom dropdown navigation to make the interactions more seamless.

Useful Resources
Bootstrap Documentation - Helped me set up a responsive navigation bar quickly.
